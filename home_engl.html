            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I have been on the Path of self-discovery and healing ever since I can remember. My childhood was
                turbulent as well as my teen age, where the country that I was born in was violently shattered. That
                country was Yugoslavia. Together with my people of Bosnia, we went through a horrific war in the 1990s
                which left us all robbed of identity, safety, joy, and life!
                <br>
                <br>
                At age 21 I moved by myself to the USA as a refugee and stayed for 18 years. I felt lost and had to look
                for myself for a long time. l rebuilt and raised myself, stone by stone. I nurtured my deep core wounds
                of trauma through great tools and met wonderful teachers of Reiki, School of Consciousness, Native
                American Shamans practice and Drum circles. But above all, yoga was my biggest tool for self-discovery
                and healing. It raised me from the deepest darkness of depression and anxiety.
                <br>
                <br>
                We store so much in our bodies and through movement, sweat and breath we are able to release it, renew
                it and rewire our neurons. I felt that I have found a spring of pure gold and felt strongly to share it.
                To spread techniques of Yoga is my life Dharma. I believe that Yoga is the way of healing the world one
                person at a time. As we feel better in our body, heart and mind, we are able to make new conscious
                choices instead of being stuck like a broken record, continuing to hurt ourselves and others. Now more
                than ever, we need to learn to love and care for ourselves, this Planet and all living beings. This is
                the most important work we can do in our lives.
